## Things needing FeathersJS-group attention
As I'm new at this many details are somewhat of a mystery. I've taken the `feathers-memory` adapter as my template. but please take a look at
   - all the links above 
   - `webpack.config.js` and verify its sanity
   - verify `package.json` is filled out as to your specifications
   - the `types` directory probably needs a lot of attention
   - This package probably need some extra documentation. Where should I (or someone else) put this? Do you have some input to what's needed?

> I have a sample Quasar-Cordova-FeathersJS-MongoDB [app](https://github.com/mhillerstrom/Quasar-Cordova) showcasing `feathers-offline-owndata`. It's still not complete, but it will show offline ability.

## Installation

```
npm install feathers-offline-owndata --save
```


## Documentation

You can read the docs [here](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/offline-first/readme.html).

For both implementations you must assure that the table (or collection) under own-data/own-net control *must* implement both `uuid` and `updatedAt` attributes.

> **Pro tip:** If your key is not `uuid` then you have to manually set the key *before* calling `create` as you have no guarantee that the backend answers.

> **Pro tip:** If you want the back-end to hold all users' data in one table (or collection), then all rows (or documents) must include a user identification (e.g. '`_id`' of `users`) and an appropriate query should be set in the `options` parameter when registering the replicator (e.g. `{query: {userId: <whatever-the-value-is>}}`).

Also, updates from a requested sync will not execute any hooks but any queued events on the device will (both on back-end and on any other devices).

### The own-data principle implementation

There are multiple situations to consider

Situation | Client unit | Back-end
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |   | The back-end holds (multiple) users' data in same storage (the shared truth)
| Joins for first time | request sync from before app was born | deliver all relevant records |
| Joins after first time | request sync from newest `updatedAt` from latest sync | deliver all relevant records |
| Changes data (online) | change local data immediately | | |
| | record and send change to back-end | change relevant data and acknowledge | |
| | remove record of change | | |
| Changes data (offline) | change local data immediately |  |
| | queue mutation on device |  |
| Reconnects (online) | request sync from newest `updatedAt` from latest sync | deliver all relevant records |
| | send relevant (i.e. `updatedAt` newer on device or removed after `updatedAt`) queued mutations in order to back-end | change relevant data |
| | | (relevant hooks executes for each change) |


### The own-net principle implementation

Again, there are multiple situations to consider

Situation | Client unit | Back-end
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |   | The back-end holds multiple users' data in same storage (the shared truth)
| Joins for first time | request sync from before app was born | deliver all relevant records |
| Joins after first time | request sync from newest `updatedAt` from latest sync | deliver all relevant records |
| Changes data (online) | change local data immediately | | |
| | record and send change to back-end. If data item already is in queue, alter it to reflect result | change relevant data and acknowledge | |
| | remove change from queue |  | |
| Changes data (offline) | change local data immediately |  |
| | queue mutation on device. If data item already is in queue, alter it to reflect result |  |
| Reconnects (online) | request sync from newest `updatedAt` from latest sync | deliver all relevant records |
| | send relevant (i.e. `updatedAt` newer on device or removed after `updatedAt`) queued mutations in order to back-end | change relevant data |
| | | (relevant hooks executes for each net change) |
